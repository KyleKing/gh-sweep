# Contributing to gh-sweep

## Setup

Prerequisites: Go (see `go.mod`), [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/), [hk](https://hk.jdx.dev/)

```bash
mise install
hk install --mise
mise run ci
```

## Tasks

Shared tasks live in `.config/mise/conf.d/template.toml` (managed by the copier template).
Project-specific tasks go in additional `.config/mise/conf.d/*.toml` files.

mise loads `conf.d/*.toml` files in alphabetical order, and a task defined in more
than one file resolves to whichever file loaded last. Name your project file so it
sorts after `template.toml` (`user.toml` works; `project.toml` does not, since
`p` < `t`) or a same-named task override will silently do nothing.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `mise run bench` | Run benchmarks |
| `mise run brew:sha` | Print the SHA256 steps for the Homebrew formula (run after a release) |
| `mise run build` | Build binary |
| `mise run ci` | Full CI check (tests + golden tests + build) |
| `mise run clean` | Clean build artifacts |
| `mise run demo` | Generate VHS demo recordings |
| `mise run format` | Auto-fix lint and formatting |
| `mise run hooks` | Run git hooks |
| `mise run lint` | Run linter |
| `mise dev` | Run from source (`go run`, always reflects current code) |
| `mise run test` | Run tests with coverage |
| `mise run test:coverage-min` | Verify the 70% coverage threshold |
| `mise run test:golden` | Run golden snapshot tests |
| `mise run test:golden-update` | Regenerate golden snapshots |
| `mise run test:safety` | Check tests for un-faked GitHub client construction |
| `mise run test:view-coverage` | View coverage report in browser |
| `mise tasks` | List all available tasks |

## Code Guidelines

Follow [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for code organization, testing patterns, and error handling.

Linting is configured in `.golangci.toml`. Run `mise run format` to auto-fix. A legacy exclusion block suppresses the style and complexity linters across `internal/` until the component refactor (ROADMAP M3); correctness linters stay enforced everywhere.

## Git Workflow

Conventional commits enforced via [commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

Git hooks run automatically via hk on commit and push.


## Development Install

Run straight from source with `go run`, which always reflects the current code, so there's no built binary or installed extension to go stale between edits:

```bash
go run ./cmd/gh-sweep [args]
```

To test the actual `gh gh-sweep ...` extension invocation or a Homebrew install, use the released version rather than installing from this checkout:

```bash
gh extension install KyleKing/gh-sweep
# or
brew install --formula https://github.com/KyleKing/gh-sweep/raw/main/Formula/gh-sweep.rb
```


## Releases

Automated by the Bump Version workflow. **Note:** For GH CLI extensions, the first release is required before users can run `gh extension install KyleKing/gh-sweep`.

### Creating a Release

1. Land a `fix:` or `feat:` commit on `main`. Commit types commitizen does not bump (`docs:`, `build(deps):`) cut no tag and publish nothing.

2. GitHub Actions will automatically:
   - Bump the version, update CHANGELOG.md, and push a `bump:` commit
   - Tag the new version
   - Run goreleaser to build binaries for Linux, macOS, Windows, and FreeBSD (amd64/arm64) and publish the release

   goreleaser runs inside that same workflow because a tag pushed with `GITHUB_TOKEN` does not trigger any other workflow.

3. Verify the release has properly named binaries:
   - `gh-sweep-linux-amd64`
   - `gh-sweep-darwin-arm64`
   - `gh-sweep-windows-amd64.exe`
   - etc.

### Updating the Homebrew Formula

After a release, update `Formula/gh-sweep.rb`:

1. Download the release binaries from the GitHub release page
2. Generate SHA256 checksums:

   ```bash
   shasum -a 256 gh-sweep-darwin-arm64 gh-sweep-darwin-amd64 gh-sweep-linux-arm64 gh-sweep-linux-amd64
   ```

   Or run `mise run brew:sha` for a reminder of these steps.

3. Update the `version` and `sha256` values in `Formula/gh-sweep.rb`
4. Commit and push the formula changes

### Installing via Homebrew

Users can install directly from the repository formula:

```bash
brew install --formula https://github.com/KyleKing/gh-sweep/raw/main/Formula/gh-sweep.rb
```

Or from a local checkout:

```bash
brew install --formula ./Formula/gh-sweep.rb
```

To set up a [homebrew tap](https://docs.brew.sh/Taps) for `brew install KyleKing/tap/gh-sweep`, create a `homebrew-tap` repo at `https://github.com/KyleKing/homebrew-tap` and copy the formula there.


## Troubleshooting

```bash
mise install --force   # Reinstall tools
hk install --mise --force  # Reinstall hooks
go test -v -run TestName ./package  # Debug specific test
go test -tags=golden -run TestGolden ./internal/tui/... -update  # Refresh stale goldens
```
